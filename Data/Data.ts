Over time, I've found myself drawn to building things, learning by doing, and being part of communities that support that journey. Through my involvement with the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) on campus and AWS Cloud Club, I’ve had the chance to work on projects, contribute to events, and collaborate with others who are equally eager to learn and grow. It's helped me explore different areas of tech and develop skills beyond the classroom. Outside of academics, I’m also a member of the institute basketball team. Playing regularly has taught me a lot about teamwork, consistency, and staying focused — lessons that often carry over into other parts of life too.Together, these experiences continue to shape how I learn, build, and work with others — and I look forward to seeing where they take me next.",
